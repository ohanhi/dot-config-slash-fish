# My personal fish configuration

## The prompt

Based on the oh-my-fish theme _gnuykeaj_, with a home-relative path (`~/.config`) and minor tweaks to make it work nicely on a dark terminal. There is no blue color in the prompt.

`config.fish` is the most opinionated part, including npm related path stuff etc.
